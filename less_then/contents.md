# Less Then

Write a program called `less_then.py` to determine whether a number is smaller than 10.0.

Your program should prompt the user to input a floating-point number and then display whether it is smaller than 10.0 or not.

### Example Usage 1

    Enter a number: 5.0
    5.0 is smaller then 10.0!

### Example Usage 2

    Enter a number: 11.3
    11.3 is not smaller then 10.0!

## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python less_then.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy less_then
