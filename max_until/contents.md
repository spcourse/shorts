# Max Until

Write a program called `max_until.py` that asks the user to repeatedly enter numbers until a non-positive number is entered. The program should report the maximum number that user entered.

### Example Usage:

    Enter a positive number: 3
    Enter a positive number: 1
    Enter a positive number: 6
    Enter a positive number: 2
    Enter a positive number: 0
    The biggest number you entered was 6.

## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python max_until.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy max_until
