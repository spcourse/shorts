# Max

Write a program called `max.py` that defines a function `max(lst)` which takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum value in the list. If the list is empty, the function should return `None`.

### Example Usage

    l = [1, 6, 19, 2, -8]
    m = max(l)
    print(f"The maximum value of {l} is {m}.")

### Expected Output

    The maximum value of [1, 6, 19, 2, -8] is 19

## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python max.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy max
