# Sum

Write a program called `sum.py` that calculates the sum of all integers in a given range. The program should prompt the user to input two integers: the starting number (`a`) and the ending number (`b`). Then, it should compute the sum of all numbers from `a` to `b` (including both `a` and `b` themselves) and display the result.

### Example Usage

If the user inputs `3` for the first number and `7` for the second number, the program should calculate the sum of `3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7` and display the result.

Here is an example of how the program should work:

    Enter first number: 3
    Enter second number: 7


    The sum of all numbers from 3 to 7 is 25.

## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python sum.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy sum
