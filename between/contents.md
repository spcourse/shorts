# Between

Write a program called `between.py` that asks the user to input two integers: a starting number (`a`) and an ending number (`b`). The program should then print all the integers starting from `a` to `b` (including `a` but _excluding_ `b`).

### Example Usage:

    Enter first number: 3  
    Enter second number: 8

    3  
    4  
    5  
    6  
    7

## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python between.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy between
