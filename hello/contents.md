# Hello

## Context

In Python you use the `print()`-command to display text. So, the following program prints the text "hello":

    print("hello")

There are some things to note about this program:

- The name of the command is `print`.
- The thing we want to print is put in parenthesis.
- We use quotes ("") to indicate that "hello" is a text (as opposed to, for instance, a number).

## Goal

Write a program called `hello.py` that prints the text "Hello, world!"

## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python hello.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy hello
