# First or Last Year

Write a program called `first_or_last_year.py`, that determines whether a given year is the **first year of a century** or **last year of a century**.  

The program should prompt the user to input a year and then display the appropriate message based on the above conditions.

### Example Usage 1

    Enter a year: 1901
    1901 is the first year of the century!

### Example Usage 2

    Enter a year: 2000
    2000 is the last year of the century!

### Example Usage 3

    Enter a year: 1999
    1999 is neither the first nor last year of the century.

## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python first_or_last_year.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy first_or_last_year
