# Min

Write a program called `min.py` that defines a function `min(a, b)` which takes two numbers as input and returns the smaller of the two. Make sure that the function works with the example code below.

### Example Usage

    x = 10
    y = 5
    m = min(x, y)
    print(m)

    x = 8
    y = 16
    m = min(x, y)
    print(m)

### Expected Output

    5
    8

## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python min.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy min
