# Positive List

Write a program called `positive_list.py` that allows the user to create a list of positive integers by entering numbers one at a time.

## Requirements:

1. Prompt the user to enter positive integers. Continue accepting inputs until the user enters a non-positive number (zero or negative).
2. Store all the entered positive integers in a list and print it.

### Example Usage:

If the user enters `5`, `10`, `15`, and `-1`:

    Enter a positive number: 5
    Enter a positive number: 10
    Enter a positive number: 15
    Enter a positive number: -1
    My positive number list: [5, 10, 15]


## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python positive_list.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy positive_list
