# Oranges

Write a program called `oranges.py` that calculates how many oranges can be evenly distributed into a given number of baskets (so each basket should contain an equal amount of oranges), and how many oranges are left over after the distribution.

Your program should prompt the user to input two numbers: the total number of oranges and the total number of baskets. It should then output the number of oranges placed in each basket and the number of oranges remaining.

## Example Usage

    Number of oranges? 25
    Number of baskets? 4

    We put 6 oranges in each basket.
    We have 1 oranges left.

## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python oranges.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy oranges
