# Count Leap Years

Write a program called `count_leap_years.py` that counts the number leap years within a given range of years. The program should prompt the user to input two years: the starting year (`a`) and the ending year (`b`). For the year sin the range from `a` to `b` (including `a` but _excluding_ `b`), the program should count the total number of leap years.

### Example Usage

    Enter first year: 2000
    Enter second year: 2021

    The number of leap years between 2000 and 2021 is 6

## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python count_leap_years.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy count_leap_years
