# Leap Years

Write a program called `leap_years.py` that finds leap years within a given range of years. The program should prompt the user to input two years: the starting year (`a`) and the ending year (`b`). For each year in the range from `a` to `b` (including `a` but _excluding_ `b`), the program should print whether it is a leap year or not.

### Example Usage

    Enter first year: 2000
    Enter second year: 2005

    2000 is a leap year!
    2001 is not a leap year.
    2002 is not a leap year.
    2003 is not a leap year.
    2004 is a leap year!

## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python leap_years.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy leap_years
