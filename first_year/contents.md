# First Year

Write a program called `first_year.py` to determine whether a given year is the first year of a century. A year is the first year of a century if it is one more than a multiple of 100 (e.g., 1901, 2001, etc.).

Your program should prompt the user to input a year and then display whether the year is the first year of a century or not.

### Example Usage 1

    Enter a year: 2001
    2001 is the first year of the century!

### Example Usage 2

    Enter a year: 1999
    1999 is not the first year of the century.

## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python first_year.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy first_year
