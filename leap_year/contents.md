# Leap Year

Write a program called `leap_year.py` that that determines whether a given year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100. But, if it's divisible by 400 it is a leap year.

The program should prompt the user to input a year and then display whether the year is a leap year or not.

### Example Usage

    Enter a year: 2024
    2024 is a leap year!

## Run

Run your program and verify that it indeed displays the expected text:

    python leap_year.py

## Checkpy

You can use checkpy to verify that it meets our requirements:

    checkpy leap_year
